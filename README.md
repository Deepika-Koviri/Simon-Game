Simon Game â€“ A Classic Memory Challenge
The Simon Game is a fun and interactive memory game designed to test and improve a playerâ€™s ability to recall and repeat sequences. It is a modern digital version of the iconic electronic memory game from 1978.

Gameplay Overview
The game consists of four colored buttonsâ€”red, blue, green, and yellowâ€”each producing a unique sound when pressed. The game begins with a single button lighting up and playing a sound. The player must repeat the sequence by clicking the correct button.

As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more complex, challenging the player's memory and concentration. The goal is to memorize and reproduce the longest sequence possible. If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they must restart from the beginning.

Features of the Game
ðŸŽ¯ Simple Yet Addictive â€“ Easy to learn but increasingly challenging as the sequence grows.
ðŸ”Š Engaging Sound and Visuals â€“ Each button has a distinct color and sound, enhancing the experience.
ðŸ§  Boosts Memory & Focus â€“ Encourages cognitive skills by testing recall ability.
ðŸŽ® Endless Replayability â€“ Play as many times as you like to beat your high score!

Objective
The challenge is to see how long you can remember and replicate the sequence without making a mistake. The longer you play, the faster the sequences appear, testing both memory and reaction speed.
